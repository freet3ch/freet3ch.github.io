OBSOLETE - replaced by _article/eulers-sine.md.

A sine wave emerges from Euler's Formula. 

Just music, with no narration. 

The background music is *Book Bag* by E's Jammy Jams. 

Animated with d3.js, [source code](https://github.com/willymcallister/spinningnumbers/tree/master/_articles/d3a/eulers-sinewave-d3.html).
