If you multiply the imaginary unit *j* by itself over and over, it creates a rotation. This is *the* reason complex numbers are used so much in engineering.

Here's Sal's introduction to [complex and imaginary numbers](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/introduction-to-complex-numbers-algebra-2).

This is an updated version of the same [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giO5ACdU2LA) on Khan Academy. A few verbal slips have been removed.
