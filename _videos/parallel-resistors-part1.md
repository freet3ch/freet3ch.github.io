* Compute the current in R1 and R2. Add them together. 
* Compute an equivalent parallel resistor for the two resistors.
* Find the current flowing in the equivalent resistor. 
* Compare the sum of i1 + i2 to the current in the equivalent resistor. 
* Click on **DC** to run the simulation. Does the simulator match your calculations?
