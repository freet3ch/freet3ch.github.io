* Compute the currents in the individual resistors. i1 = 3V/R1, i2 = 3V/R2, etc. 
* Compute an equivalent parallel resistor for the four resistors using the parallel resistor formula from this video.
* Find the current flowing in the equivalent resistor. i_total = 3V/Requiv
* Compare the sum of individual currents to the current in the equivalent resistor. 
* Click on **DC** to run the simulation. Does the simulator match your calculations?
