Euler's formula is the most important tool in AC analysis. It is why electrical engineers need to understand complex numbers. It relates the complex exponential $e^{\pm j\text{something}}$ to the cosine and sine functions.

Sal derives Euler's formula [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc/bc-series-new/bc-10-14/v/euler-s-formula-and-euler-s-identity) using McLaurin expansions of $e^{ix}, \sin x,$ and $\cos x$.
