The Node Voltage Method solves circuits with the minimum number of KCL equations. 

The steps of the Node Voltage Method are,  

1. Assign a reference node (ground).
2. Assign node voltage names to the remaining nodes.
3. Solve the easy nodes, the ones connected to ground through a voltage source.
4. Write Kirchhoff's Current Law at each node using node voltages.
5. Solve the resulting system of equations to find the node voltages.
6. Find the currents using Ohm's Law.
