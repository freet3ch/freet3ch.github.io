Introduction to the most common circuit elements: resistor, capacitor, and inductor.

<summary>At 4:11, a special notation from calculus: $dv/dt$</summary>
<p>$i = \text C\,\dfrac{dv}{dt}$</p>

<p>$d$ is calculus notation for 'differential', or "a tiny change in ...". For example, $dt$ means 'a tiny change in time'. When you see it in a ratio, like $dv/dt$, that means, "a tiny change in $v$ (voltage) for each tiny change in time" An expression like $dv/dt$ is called a <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-derivative-intro/ab-defining-derivative/v/calculus-derivatives-1-new-hd-version">derivative</a>. The derivative is the slope of voltage as it changes over time. When voltage changes rapidly across a capacitor, the current is high.</p>
