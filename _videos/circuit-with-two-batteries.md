A learner wrote in with this question as she prepared for a physics final. It's looks complicated. But there's a trick! 

Created by Willy McAllister. (This is the very first video I made for Khan Academy.)

To make the simulator work you have to remove one of the batteries. Notice $i$ has the same value as the original circuit. Notice all the current flows through the one battery.
