When resistors are connected head-to-tail we say they are in series. The equivalent overall series resistance is the sum of the individual resistance values.

* Calculate the series equivalent resistor for the three resistors. 
* Find the resulting current using Ohm's Law. 
* Find the *element voltage* across each resistor. 
* Find the *node voltage* at each node (the voltage with respect to the ground node). 
* Click on **DC** to simulate the circuit. The simulator shows you the *node voltages*.
* Challenge: Change any resistor values to get 1.00V at the top of R2.
