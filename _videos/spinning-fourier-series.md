Math animation genius Grant Sanderson [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) created this complex Fourier series that spells out Spinning Numbers on the complex plane---using spinning numbers!

Each letter is drawn with 150 complex exponentials (spinning numbers) linked head to tail (vector add). The frequency of rotation of each successively shorter vector is an integer multiple of the base frequency. Integer multiple spacing is what makes it a Fourier series.
