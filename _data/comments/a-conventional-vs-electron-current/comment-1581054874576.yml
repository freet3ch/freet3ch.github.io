  Tristan - Yes, that's right. The term 'voltage' is the honorary name of
  'potential difference'. High potential means high voltage. If you have a
  high-voltage battery you can think of it as a tall hill. If you imagine
  positive charge coming out of the positive terminal, it starts at the top of
  the tall hill and has a tall amount of potential energy. On the other hand, if
  you think about the electrons, they come out of the negative terminal and
  start at the bottom of the tall hill. They have a lot of potential energy
  because they are about to roll way 'uphill' towards the positive terminal.
  It's kind of goofy to have something roll uphill, but electric charge rolls
  both ways depending on the sign of the charge.
