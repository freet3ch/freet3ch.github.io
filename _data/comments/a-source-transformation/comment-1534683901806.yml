message: "On \"Traditional circuit analysis: Write Kirchhoffâ€™s Current Law for the top node; add up currents flowing into the node\", we see the equation:\r\n\r\nI_N - vR_N + i = 0\r\n\r\nShouldn't the second term be \"voltage divided by resistance\", i. e. \"v / R_N\"?\r\n\r\nAlso, this sentence:\r\n\r\n\"Put open and *sort* circuits across the port and \r\nmeasure with your mental multimeter.\"\r\n\r\nI think you meant:\r\n\r\n\"Put open and *short* circuits across the port and measure with your mental multimeter.\""
