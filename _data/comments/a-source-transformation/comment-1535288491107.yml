message: "In one of my old high school textbooks, the current in the Th√©venin circuit was drawn in a rightwards direction (from the resistor outwards, towards the upper right port), thus avoiding the need of correcting the equations with a minus sign, and mirror flipping the i-v plot over the v axis.\r\nIn fact, the equation of the line in this specific example would have been:\r\n\r\ni(v) = 5/2000 - (1/2000)v\r\n\r\n(Unfortunately, I cannot add a picture here for reference).\r\n\r\nDo you think the two methods are equivalent? Or maybe one has advantages over the other?"
