  Thank you for your insight. Initially, the former method made more sense to
  me, because I was more accustomed to an "upwards" i-v plot (the one where the
  current function i(v) is already on the positive region of the i-v plane,
  without the need of changing its sign), but you are absolutely right in saying
  that a well-functioning and flexible engineering mind needs to be able to
  handle minus signs without fear!
