message: "Simulators turn a \"natural device\" into a collection of basic elements (resistors, capacitors, diodes, and dependent voltage or current sources). See for example the Ebers-Moll model (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor#Ebers%E2%80%93Moll_model).\r\n\r\nThe simulator builds a matrix with these device models plus the resistors and capacitors you add yourself. The matrix is solved to get the node voltages and element currents. The method is a lot like the Node Voltage Method https://spinningnumbers.org/a/node-voltage.html."
