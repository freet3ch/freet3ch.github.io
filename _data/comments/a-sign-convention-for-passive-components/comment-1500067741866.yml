message: "This definition applies to the term \"voltage\". \"Volt\" is the honorary name of electric potential difference. \r\n\r\nThe Passive Sign Convention is more of a bookkeeping rule. If we want to have only one version of Ohm's Law, with no minus signs in it, we need to have a rule that the voltage and current polarities have to be arranged in the proper way. It would be a drag to have two versions of Ohm's Law so we could let everyone draw polarity any which way. Sometimes you would use v = iR, and other times v = -iR, and there would be tons of errors."
