  The second power example is where I apply the sign convention for passive
  components to an "active" (not passive) circuit element, the voltage source.
  We are abusing the passive sign convention somewhat when we do this, but let's
  see what happens. The current arrow points in to the + terminal of the voltage
  source. The current arrow defines which direction we consider as positive
  current. That doesn't mean current actually flows that way, but if it did, its
  value would have a + sign. In fact, we know the current flows the other way,
  out of the + battery terminal and into the top of the resistor. So with the
  current arrow pointing into the battery, the value of the current is a
  negative value, i = -8mA. If you do a power calculation on the voltage source
  you multiply a positive voltage times a negative current, ending up with a
  negative power for an object that generates power. That is an outcome of using
  the passive sign convention.
