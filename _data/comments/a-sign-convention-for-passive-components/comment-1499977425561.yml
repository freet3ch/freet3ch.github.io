message: "\"An electric potential (also called the electric field potential or the electrostatic potential) is the amount of work needed to move a unit positive charge from a reference point to a specific point inside the field without producing any acceleration.\" cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_potential\r\n\r\nThis definition of potential seems to me explain this passive element convention through physics, isn't it? Positive charges go from higher potential to lower potential.\r\n\r\nIs this correct?\r\n\r\nThank you!"
