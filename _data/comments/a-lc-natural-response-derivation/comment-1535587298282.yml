  There are two units for measuring frequency: radians/sec and cycles/sec (Hz).
  Both are valid, and one is not truer than the other. The simplest expression
  for the natural frequency of LC and RLC circuits is units of rad/sec.
  (Simplest because you donâ€™t have to carry along a 2pi term.) In physics class
  where you have objects zooming around in circles they have angular velocity,
  and the units are also rad/sec.
