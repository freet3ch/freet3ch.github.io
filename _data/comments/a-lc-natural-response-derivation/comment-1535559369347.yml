message: "We defined ω_0 as the natural frequency of the LC circuit. But this quantity actually has the dimensions of an angular velocity (radians per second): in fact, to determine the \"true\" frequency, we have to convert it via the formula f = ω/2π.\r\n\r\nIs it correct to say that the natural frequency of an LC circuit, when calculated as ω_0 = 1/sqrt(LC), is in fact an angular velocity?"
