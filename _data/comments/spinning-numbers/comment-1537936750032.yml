  Mr. McAllister, My system is showing a voltage drop error Across the first
  resistor I have a 2.5 Volt drop Across the second resistor I have a one Volt
  drop Together as you see that's 3.5 volts From a 3 Volt supply All resistors
  all nodes are connected correctly The ground Fire clowns seems to be a
  different style than the one depicted In the Class But it is indeed a ground
  All voltages 3 bolts Applied All resistances 1K 3K,2K Are correct Please
  adVISE If you know of any fixes For the system
