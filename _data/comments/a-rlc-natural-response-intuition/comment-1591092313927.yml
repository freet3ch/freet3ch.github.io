message: "Dear Mr. McAllister, \r\nCould you please elaborate on your explanation regarding the dissipation of energy and its effect on the \"moving charge\". It is this sentence in particular that confused me: \"A little bit of that charge is de-energized and does not make it all the way over to the bottom of the capacitor.\"\r\n\r\nIf charge doesn't make it all the way across, wouldn't that imply accumulation of charge at some point on the circuit? And if that ponit is the top plate of the capacitor, wouldn't that mean that the capacitor will not get fully discharged?"
