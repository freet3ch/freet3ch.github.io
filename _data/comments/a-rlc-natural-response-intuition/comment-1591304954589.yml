message: "We start out with an imbalance of charge on the plates of the capacitor. That’s where the capacitor voltage comes from, v = q/C, where q is the amount of excess charge on one plate, and the amount of missing charge on the other plate. We close the switch and sit back to watch what happens “naturally”. The top plate is missing electrons, so it has a + charge relative to the bottom plate. Let’s follow that +q. \r\n\r\nCharge flows off the top plate, around through L and R, to the bottom plate. As q passes through L it cranks up a magnetic field surrounding the inductor (this stores energy in L). Over at C, there’s a brief moment when the capacitor has equal charge, and the voltage is 0 for an instant. You might think everything stops, but it doesn’t. The energy in L keeps shoving charge over on to the bottom plate of C. This keeps happening until L is out of energy. At this point charge stops moving, and the capacitor state is very nearly the exact opposite of where we started. The +q charge is now on the bottom plate. The process reverses, and charge flows the other way for a while. \r\n\r\nIf there is resistance in the circuit, a little energy is lost every time charge passes through R. That energy is lost as heat, and is not available to be stored in L. That means L has less energy to force all of +q over on to the opposite plate of C. A little bit of the starting +q is left behind each time That’s why you see the peak voltage slowly go down and fade away. \r\n\r\nMy phrasing “A little bit of that charge is de-energized” is a little too informal. I meant a little bit of charge stays behind on the capacitor “source” plate and no longer participates in the oscillation."
