message: "\"A changing current creates a changing magnetic field, which creates a constant voltage. We write this mathematically with an equation that you may have seen before: v = L (di/dt)\"\r\n\r\nYou have assumed  here that di/dt is constant for the Orsted experiment isn't it? \r\n\r\nIf we have for instance i = sin(wt) the resultant voltage is another sinusoidal. Can we found circuits with current expressed by oddest mathematical functions and real utility? \r\n\r\nThank you!"
