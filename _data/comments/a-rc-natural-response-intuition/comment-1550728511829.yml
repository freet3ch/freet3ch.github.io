  We start out with charge on the capacitor and the switch in the down position
  (for a long time). When there is charge on the capacitor that means a voltage
  appears: q = Cv, or v = q/C. That voltage also appears across the resistor.
  What does a resistor do when it has a voltage? It conducts, i = v/R. That
  current is made of charge flowing out of the capacitor. If you leave the
  switch in the down position a long time the charge eventually runs out, it
  "drains" through the resistor. When the charge runs out then q = 0, which
  means v = q/C = 0. This is why the assumed initial value of v is 0.
