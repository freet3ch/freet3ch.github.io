  Gabriel - I am using a free MailGun account. (It is not actually free any
  more, but the charges are tiny, like  $0.80/1,000 messages, for small amounts
  of mail.) The sandbox user has significant restrictions. You can only mail to
  5 'authorized recipients' that you need to set up. Also, I think the sandbox
  is not capable of receiving mail from outside. When you send a message to
  MailGun are you observing the log messages at MailGun? The other place to get
  debug info is within your browser.  Watch what happens when the comment_form
  is submitted. You dig this data out of the developer tools.
