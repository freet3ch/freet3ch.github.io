  For such a simple circuit the RC has an odd twist, and you found it. To get
  the sign right you have to respect the Sign Convention for Passive Components.
  If we look at the second schematic, let's keep the definition of $v$ with $+$ at
  the top, and the definition of $i$ flowing to the right, into the $+$ terminal
  of the capacitor. The $i$-$v$ equation for the capacitor is the usual, $i =
  Cdv/dt$. BUT, over at the resistor the current is flowing UP. When $i$ is
  positive, the BOTTOM of the resistor will have a higher voltage than the top.
  By the sign convention for passives, when you write the resistor
  voltage in terms of the variable $v$ you have to include a minus sign. $-v = i
  R$.  The rest of the derivation is the same.
