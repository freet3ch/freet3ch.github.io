message: "Jon,\r\nWelcome to spinningnumbers. The articles you find here are all freshened up and improved compared to the ones on KA with a similar title. Many articles included simulation models so you can fiddle with the circuits yourself. So far, the videos posted here at spinningnumbers are the same ones I did for KA. I hope you enjoy your studies. Please ask questions and let me know what works and what doesn't as far as making the ideas understandable."
