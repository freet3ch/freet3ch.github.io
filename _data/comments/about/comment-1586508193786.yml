message: "Thanks so much for the videos and articles! I'm an IT graduate who found a love for electronics, but only studied high school physics and felt really lost. Your teaching style is really engaging and I definitely feel like I'm learning a lot from you!\r\n\r\nWhat textbooks or other resources would you recommend a beginner? I wonder if you've ever thought about writing your own book on EE! :)"
