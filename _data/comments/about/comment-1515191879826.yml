message: "Robert - Welcome to spinningnumbers. Here are the pro's and con's for using this site vs KA.\r\n\r\nAs of right now, the videos are all the same. My new year's resolution is to add new videos to spinningnumbers. in the coming year. \r\n\r\nPro's for spinningnumbers...\r\n\nAll of the articles I wrote for KA have been reviewed and improved and posted to spinningnumbers. \r\nThere are some new articles here that don't appear on KA. (The first example is Charge at the top of the introduction section.)\r\nSpinningnumbers has a circuit simulator (Circuit Sandbox) that KA does not. The Sandbox has been integrated into several articles to help you understand the concepts. This is a great learning tool.\r\nIf you find an error in a spinningnumber article or video, I can fix it in a few minutes. \r\n\r\nPro's for KA... \r\n\nKA has a sophisticated point tracking and badge-awarding system that keeps track of your progress. Spinningnumbers does not. The webmaster is me and I don't know how to do that stuff.\r\nKA has a few other volunteers besides myself who answer questions. But the lion's share of EE answers still come from me. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy your learning experience here."
