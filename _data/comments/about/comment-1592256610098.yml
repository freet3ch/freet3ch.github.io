message: "Cherie, \r\nThanks for your kind comment. For other resources I suggest you visit a nearby college or university bookstore. Find out which text is used in the introductory EE circuits class. Look for the MIT online class 6.002 Circuits by Agarwal, or 6.003 Signals and Systems. https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/find-by-number/ \r\nAnother resource is Digikey or Mouser, both excellent suppliers. Buy a powerful microprocessor development board for less than $10. Look for ARM or Arduino or Raspberry. Dream up a gizmo and create it. Water your plants, scare squirrels, build a robot.\r\n\r\nAs you work through the DC Circuit Analysis section, make a collection of all the example circuits. Then go back over them and solve each one using as many Methods as you can remember. \r\n\r\nWhen I think about writing a book I worry about how to fix mistakes in paper copies already sold. I like web publishing because I can fix or improve something in minutes. But who know, maybe someday I'll commit to a book."
