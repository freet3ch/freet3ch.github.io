message: "Dear Mr. McAllister,\r\n\r\nFirst of all, let me thank you for all this incredible content. I would like to ask you if you could recommend any sources for practicing (ideally with worked solutions) the principles thought in this series. I feel I understand the theory fairly well but I know the real questions arise when you start working on problems on your own.  \r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you. \r\nKind regards,"
