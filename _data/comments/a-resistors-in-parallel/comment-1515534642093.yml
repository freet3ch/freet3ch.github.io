message: "I'm a little lost regarding the beginning of this lesson where the sum of individual currents in a parallel circuit at each node (or before each resistor) equals the total current in the circuit.  How do we know this (maybe I missed it in a previous lesson?)\r\nIf, in the first parallel resistor circuit example above, these are  distributed node before R1, R2, R3, and distributed nodes are really just a single node, what is causing the current to change?  The resistors or the node(s)?  Lost!!"
