message: "Dear Willy McAllister,\r\nGreat to see this excellent tool outside of edX. I thought it was brilliant for 6.002x. I hope you don't mind, but I was just doing a diode i-v plot and noticed that the y-axis scaling is using 'K' for kilo. I have to constantly remind students that 'K' = Kelvin and 'k' =1000 in SI units (ignoring the CS folk who use 'K' for 1024!). Great website, fantastic learning resource for would-be electrical engineers. Best wishes."
