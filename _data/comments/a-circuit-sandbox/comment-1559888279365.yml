  Kevin - Recent versions of Chrome have become picky about some older
  JavaScript syntax. Perhaps I have not yet discovered all the problem lines. If
  you know how to work Chromeâ€™s Inspector, see if you can tell me the offending
  line number in the source code of schematic.js. Or, try any other browser in
  the meantime while I fix this.
