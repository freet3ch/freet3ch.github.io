  Whenever you have a resistor circuit you are allowed to treat it as either
  resistors or conductances, your choice. The reason you would do this is to
  take advantage of the new combining equations for series and parallel. That's
  why I used conductance for one of the derivations. To combine parallel
  conductance you simply add. That change of perspective from R to G made the
  steps of the Y-to-Delta derivation look just like the Delta-to-Y algebra. I
  didn't come up with this technique myself, but it's very clever.
