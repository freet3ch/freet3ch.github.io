message: "The 555 is not a simple chip to understand. Your circuit is an astable multivibrator (http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm555.pdf, page 10, 7.4.2). R1 and R2 are configured as a voltage divider, but there’s a lot of action happening at the two nodes on either side of R2. The voltage divider assumption (negligible current flowing out of the middle node of the divider) is not met for this application. Question 1: The voltage at pin 7 is not a stable value, it moves up and down, as controlled by the 555. You should see a triangle wave at pin 7. Here’s why…\r\n\r\nHow it works: The capacitor charges up through R1+R2. Voltage rises as you would expect an RC circuit to do. The 555 keeps an eye on Vcap with Thresh (pin 6) and Trig (pin2). When Vcap gets up to 2/3 of VCC (6v * 2/3 = 4v) the Thresh pin says Ha! and turns on Discharge pin 7. The Discharge pin pulls current out of the capacitor through R2, and Vcap reverses direction and goes back down. When Vcap gets down to 1/3 of VCC (6 * 1/3 = 2v), that gets sensed by the Trig pin, #2. Inside the 555, the Trig says Ha! and causes the Discharge pin to turn off. Current to start collecting on the capacitor again and Vcap rises, just like it did at the beginning. Question 2: The capacitor has a lot of effect on the voltage at pin 7.\r\n\r\nQuestion 3: See the schematic on page 3 of the TI data sheet. Notice the voltage divider inside the 555 made with 3 identical R’s (5 kohms each). When you connect your 10K external resistors to pin 5 you are hooking them up in parallel with the internal divider. That interferes with the simple voltage divider expression you used to get 6v * 10k/(10k + 10k). Pin 5 is connected to one of the middle nodes if the internal voltage divider. It’s not connected directly to VCC. Pin 5 does not have to obey the same min/max rule that applies to VCC."
