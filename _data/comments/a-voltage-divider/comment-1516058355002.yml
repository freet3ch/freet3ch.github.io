  I suggest you build the sample project by rote, just doing what the
  instructions say. You can leave Pin 5 unconnected to start with. If you can
  get your circuit to blink the LED, then you have your foot in the door. In
  this circuit, the capacitor acts like a bucket for charge. If you provide a
  current to the capacitor, charge builds up and the voltage rises. If you take
  away charge, the voltage drops. If you multiply R * C you will get the "time
  constant" of the circuit, measured in seconds. That's roughly how fast things
  happen. RC = (10k+4.7k) * 10uF = 0.147 seconds. Your LED should blink roughly
  8-10 times/sec.
