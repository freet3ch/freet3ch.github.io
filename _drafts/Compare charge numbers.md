In terms of electron charges, $e^-$, one coulomb is the combined charge of $6.24 \times 10^{18}$ electrons. That's 6.24 billion billion $e^-$'s. 

That is a *lot* of electrons moving when the current is an ampere. So it's no wonder when we deal with everyday currents we don't count grains of sand, but instead talk about current in amperes and charge in coulombs.


Avocado's Number 6.022 x 10^23

1 liter of water = 1000 grams of water 

(1000 grams water)/(18.015 grams/mole) = 55.5093 moles 

55.5093 moles * (6.0221E23) = 3.3428E25 molecules of water
