We investigate the *natural response* of a resistor-inductor $(\text{RL})$ circuit. 

![RL natural response circuit]({% link i/rl_natural_response1.svg %}){: .centered :}

The presentation is organized into two sections,

* [RL natural response - intuition]({% link _articles/rl-natural-response-intuition.md %})

* [RL natural response - derivation]({% link _articles/rl-natural-response-derivation.md %}) 

This derivation is similar to the [RC natural response]({% link _articles/rc-natural-response-derivation.md %}).
